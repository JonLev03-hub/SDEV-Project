# Tank Game
This repository contains an interactive web application that uses HTML JS and CSS to allow users to play a tank game with friends on the same computer system. Using HTML canvas we were able to create an enteractive enviorment where you use the WASD keys and the Spacebar to control P1, and the arrow keys and the ctrl button to control player 2. Shoot the other player 2 times to move on to the next round, and the first person to 5000 points wins. At this point the game will restart
